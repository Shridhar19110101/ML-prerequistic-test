    "Matrix multiplication with NumPy is faster than with a list of lists because NumPy is implemented in C, while a list of lists is a Python data structure. This means that NumPy operations are executed in compiled code, which is generally faster than Python code. In addition, NumPy stores matrices in a contiguous block of memory, which makes it more efficient to perform operations on the data because it can be accessed more quickly by the CPU.\n",
